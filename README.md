# Max Greenberg's Website

This is the repository for [my academic website](http://www.max-greenberg.com), built in HTML and CSS using the [minimal theme](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) designed by [Steve Smith (orderedlist)](https://github.com/orderedlist/). All modifications made to the base template were done by me.
